Developer Notes
===============

- Consider Plupload if Droplet doesn't meet our needs: http://www.plupload.com/ (recommended by Josh B.)

**Demo Feedback: February 17, 2016**

- Issue in Firefox with library images - broken image icon appears in upper left corner. What's that about?
- Display message to users about which file types/extensions are valid, rather than just telling them on error.
- Issue with stacking error messages. Avoid stacking error messages (TLT has solved this in a previous sprint).
- Issue with error messages potentially not being seen if the user has scrolled down the page, but the error is displayed up top.
- Issue with staging images before uploading is that user might leave before clicking the upload button.
- What happens when one corrupted image is uploaded with a bunch of valid images? Is this handled sanely?
